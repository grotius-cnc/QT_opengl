# QT_opengl
C++ template for QT with Opengl class

User can directly start with writing the opengl code.

The program has 2 available timers :
1 timer for updating the opengl class 
1 timer for updating the mainwindow class

The do and don'ts for timers:
For example working with dxf files larger then 2mb, a timer can be better replaced by a mouse updating event.
This can handle huge file's easyer, but requires more coding knowledge and requires more seperate event routines.
But for building up the application, it's a good solution.
